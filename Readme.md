In this Project we will solve the most famous and leading pzzling problems i.e 8-puzzle problem.

Problem statement:Given a 3Ã—3 board with 8 tiles (every tile has one number from 1 to 8) and one empty space. The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match the final configuration using the empty space.

This project contains a "Projects.py" file which can be executed with an interpretor. It basicaaly takes a 3x3 matrix as a puzzle and
then returns all the intermediate steps required to achiev that final state.
This program also shows the number of steps required to reach the given target state.
-->This project is made using pyton programming language and implies the use of continuous greedy algorithm for finding the shortest possible path from
initial(puzzle)state to goal state.

Note:The blank tile in code is shown by 0 whereas other tiles are shown with numbers on them.
eg: 1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 0
